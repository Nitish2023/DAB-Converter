# DAB-Converter

This design provides an overview of the implementation of a single-phase Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC/DC converter. DAB topology offers advantages like soft-switching commutations, a decreased number of devices, and high efficiency. The design is beneficial where power density, cost, weight, galvanic isolation, high-voltage conversion ratio, and reliability are critical factors, making it ideal for EV charging stations and energy storage applications. Modularity and symmetrical structure in the DAB allow for stacking converters to achieve high power throughput and facilitate a bidirectional mode of operation to support battery charging and discharging applications

Power density and system efficiency are two important requirements of a converter in a DC charging station. Operating at high switching frequencies enables the reduced size of magnetics. By moving to higher bus voltage to facilitate fast charging, more power can be transferred at the same current level. This helps to reduce the amount of copper, thereby improving the power density of the converter. The converter must also be highly efficient as it results in significant cost savings and reduced thermal solution.<img width="740" height="487" alt="203494995-dea3e1b7-c0b1-445a-b61e-7a7c7adc6b52" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f0b50dd-a30e-4efc-b398-2284df113953" />
